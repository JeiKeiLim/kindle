# Kindle - PyTorch no-code model builder

Kindle is an easy model build package for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). Building a deep learning model became so simple that almost all model can be made by copy and paste from other existing model codes. So why code? when we can simply build a model with yaml markup file.

Kindle builds a model with no code but yaml file which its method is inspired from [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## AutoML with Kindle
* [Kindle](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/kindle) offers the easiest way to build your own deep learning architecture. Beyond building a model, AutoML became easier with [Kindle](https://github.com/JeiKeiLim/kindle) and [Optuna](https://optuna.org) or other optimization frameworks.
