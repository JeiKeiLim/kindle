# Kindle - Making a PyTorch model easier than ever!

Kindle is an easy model build package for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). Building a deep learning model became so simple that almost all model can be made by copy and paste from other existing model codes. So why code? when we can simply build a model with yaml markup file.

Kindle builds a model with yaml file which its method is inspired from [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## Installation
**PyTorch** is required prior to install. Please visit [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install.
